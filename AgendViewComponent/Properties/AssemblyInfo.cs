// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to display appointments in Agenda View by using the GridControl component
// 
// In fact, the Agenda view is a list of upcoming events grouped by the
// appointment's date. This list can be displayed in the GridControl component
// (https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument3464).
// 
// This
// example demonstrates how to implement this behavior.
// 
// 
// Switching between the
// SchedulerControl's view and a GridControl instance (used as an AgendaView) is
// implemented by switching the visibility of the SchedulerControl and GridControl
// instances.
// 
// Since multi-day appointments should be displayed as several
// GridView rows (such appointments should be displayed in each "Day" group in
// accordance with the appointment's duration), we used a separate
// AgendaAppointment class to store the appointment's data.
// 
// To get existing
// appointments from the SchedulerStorage and generate a corresponding collection
// of AgendaAppointment instances, the SchedulerStorage.GetAppointments
// (https://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/DevExpressXtraSchedulerSchedulerStorageBase_GetAppointmentstopic1830)
// method is used.
// 
// By default, a month interval is used to fetch appointments for
// the AgendaView.
// 
// 
// Please see the "Implementation Details" (click the
// corresponding link below this text) to learn more about technical aspects of
// this approach implementation.
